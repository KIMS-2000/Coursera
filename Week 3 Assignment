Statement I)Research two microcontrollers and provide information about them from their datasheets. There are several microcontroller manufacturers that you can investigate including Atmel, Microchip, Freescale, TI, etc. For each microcontroller, report the following information. (Be sure to include a link to an online reference where you found this information.)  

Ans:
1)Micro Controller-EFM8 busy bee family - EFM8BB1
                       Clock Frequency - 80kHz to 25MHz
                       Bitwidth of the datapath - 8 bit
                       Size of flash memory - upto 8kb flash memory
                       Number of pins - 18
                       Does the microcontroller contain an Analog-to-Digital Converter? - YES
