1)Identify and analyze a device that is an IoT device now, but in the past was a non-IoT device. Describe and list the features of the device. Compare the functions of the device in the past to the functions of the device now.

                                  Old Refrigerator:
                                  It is only use for freeze food items
                                  IoT Refrigerator:
                                  It control temperature through sensors
                                  Automatically place order online
                                    
2)Compare the functions of the device in the past to the functions of the device now.

                                Old Refrigerator:
                                Its only use for freeze items
                                IoT Refrigerator:
                                Touch screen
                                Maintain temperature
                                Indicate alarm when some items are low in quantity and place order online    
                                
3)For your chosen IoT device, list any improvements or any diminishments if they exist, over the non-IOT device. Describe any limitations that are present in the new IoT version of the device.

                                  Improvements:
                                  Energy efficient
                                  Diminishments:
                                  No security                                
                                  
 4)Describe any privacy issues with the IoT device that never existed in the original version of the device. Compare the price of the original device to the price of the new IoT version of the device. When performing a price comparison, attempt to normalize for the changing value of currency over time by using an online inflation calculator.

                                      Issues:
                                      Electricity consumption issues
                                      Comparision:
                                      Early 2000s old refrigerator cost between 20k- 30kpkr
                                      IoT refrigerator in 2020 cost between 60k-100k pkr
